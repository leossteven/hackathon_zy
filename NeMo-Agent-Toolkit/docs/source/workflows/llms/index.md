# LLMs

## Supported LLM Providers

NeMo Agent toolkit supports the following LLM providers:
| Provider | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| [NVIDIA NIM](https://build.nvidia.com) | `nim` | NVIDIA Inference Microservice (NIM) |
| [OpenAI](https://openai.com) | `openai` | OpenAI API |
| [AWS Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) | `aws_bedrock` | AWS Bedrock API |
| [Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/quickstart) | `azure_openai` | Azure OpenAI API |


## LLM Configuration

The LLM configuration is defined in the `llms` section of the workflow configuration file. The `_type` value refers to the LLM provider, and the `model_name` value always refers to the name of the model to use.

```yaml
llms:
  nim_llm:
    _type: nim
    model_name: meta/llama-3.1-70b-instruct
  openai_llm:
    _type: openai
    model_name: gpt-4o-mini
  aws_bedrock_llm:
    _type: aws_bedrock
    model_name: meta/llama-3.1-70b-instruct
    region_name: us-east-1
  azure_openai_llm:
    _type: azure_openai
    azure_deployment: gpt-4o-mini
```

### NVIDIA NIM

You can use the following environment variables to configure the NVIDIA NIM LLM provider:

* `NVIDIA_API_KEY` - The API key to access NVIDIA NIM resources


The NIM LLM provider is defined by the {py:class}`~nat.llm.nim_llm.NIMModelConfig` class.

* `model_name` - The name of the model to use
* `temperature` - The temperature to use for the model
* `top_p` - The top-p value to use for the model
* `max_tokens` - The maximum number of tokens to generate
* `api_key` - The API key to use for the model
* `base_url` - The base URL to use for the model
* `max_retries` - The maximum number of retries for the request

:::{note}
`temperature` and `top_p` are model-gated fields and may not be supported by all models. If unsupported and explicitly set, validation will fail. See [Gated Fields](../../extend/gated-fields.md) for details.
:::

### OpenAI

You can use the following environment variables to configure the OpenAI LLM provider:

* `OPENAI_API_KEY` - The API key to access OpenAI resources


The OpenAI LLM provider is defined by the {py:class}`~nat.llm.openai_llm.OpenAIModelConfig` class.

* `model_name` - The name of the model to use
* `temperature` - The temperature to use for the model
* `top_p` - The top-p value to use for the model
* `max_tokens` - The maximum number of tokens to generate
* `seed` - The seed to use for the model
* `api_key` - The API key to use for the model
* `base_url` - The base URL to use for the model
* `max_retries` - The maximum number of retries for the request

:::{note}
`temperature` and `top_p` are model-gated fields and may not be supported by all models. If unsupported and explicitly set, validation will fail. See [Gated Fields](../../extend/gated-fields.md) for details.

### AWS Bedrock

The AWS Bedrock LLM provider is defined by the {py:class}`~nat.llm.aws_bedrock_llm.AWSBedrockModelConfig` class.

* `model_name` - The name of the model to use
* `temperature` - The temperature to use for the model
* `top_p` - The top-p value to use for the model. This field is ignored for LlamaIndex.
* `max_tokens` - The maximum number of tokens to generate
* `context_size` - The maximum number of tokens available for input. This is only required for LlamaIndex. This field is ignored for LangChain.
* `region_name` - The region to use for the model
* `base_url` - The base URL to use for the model
* `credentials_profile_name` - The credentials profile name to use for the model
* `max_retries` - The maximum number of retries for the request

### Azure OpenAI

You can use the following environment variables to configure the Azure OpenAI LLM provider:

* `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` - The API key to access Azure OpenAI resources
* `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` - The Azure OpenAI endpoint to access Azure OpenAI resources

The Azure OpenAI LLM provider is defined by the {py:class}`~nat.llm.azure_openai_llm.AzureOpenAIModelConfig` class.

* `api_key` - The API key to use for the model
* `api_version` - The API version to use for the model
* `azure_endpoint` - The Azure OpenAI endpoint to use for the model
* `azure_deployment` - The name of the Azure OpenAI deployment to use
* `temperature` - The temperature to use for the model
* `top_p` - The top-p value to use for the model
* `seed` - The seed to use for the model
* `max_retries` - The maximum number of retries for the request

:::{note}
`temperature` is model-gated and may not be supported by all models. See [Gated Fields](../../extend/gated-fields.md) for details.
